# BlinkIT-sales-Analysis-Dashboared (Interactive Dashboard using MS Excel)
I developed a comprehensive project in Excel using multiple dashboard and table to analyze the data. This process involves several stages  data processing , data manipulation, data visualization.

## Project Objective
The blinkit  wants to conduct a comprehensive analysis of Blinkit's sales performance, customer satisfaction, and inventory distribution to identify key insights and opportunities for optimization using various KPIs and visualizations.
## Dataset used

## Process
- Verify data for any missing values and anomalies, and sort out the same.

- Made sure data is consistent and clean with respect to data type, data format and values used.

- Created pivot tables according to the questions asked.

- Merge all pivot tables into one dashboard and apply slicer to make dynamic.

## insights

- Regular Fat products dominate sales, contributing approximately 60-65% of the total revenue, while Low Fat products make up the rest
- Tier 3 Outlets consistently lead in total sales (around 39-42% of total revenue), followed by Tier 2, and then Tier 1.
- Total Sales of $36.33M (or $1.20M based on common data sets) and 8523 items indicates strong overall market penetration and operational scale.
